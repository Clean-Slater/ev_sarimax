# A SARIMAX TIME SERIES MODEL TO  PREDICT EXPANSION OF ELECTRIC  VEHICLE MARKET IN INDIA
We develop a SARIMAX (Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors) model to forecast short term and long-term Electric Vehicle sales, with fuel prices and passenger car sales as external regressors

SARIMAX model can be viewed as a multiple regression model with seasonal differencing with one or more autoregressive (AR) terms and/or one or more moving average (MA) terms. This method is suitable for forecasting when data is stationary/non stationary, and multivariate with any type of data pattern, i.e., level/trend /seasonality/cyclicity
